      body: Dabous is located in north-eastern Niger, where the Ténéré desert meets
        the slopes of the Aïr Mountains. The area has been part of the trans-Saharan
        caravan trade route traversed by the Tuareg for over two millennia, but archaeological
        evidence shows much older occupation in the region dating back 8,000 years.
        More recently, it has become known to a wider global audience for its exceptional
        rock art.

        Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

        Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

        The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

        We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

        While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

        Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

      body: Gobero is located at the western tip of the Ténéré desert in Niger, approximately
        150 km south-east of the Aïr Mountains. Situated on the edge of a paleaolake
        and dating from the early Holocene (7,700–6,200 years ago), it is the earliest
        recorded cemetery in the western Sahara and consists of around 200 burials.
        Skeletal evidence shows both male and females to be tall in stature, approaching
        two metres. Some of the burials included items of jewellery, including a young
        girl wearing a bracelet made from the tusk of a hippo, and a man buried with
        the shell of a turtle.

        was based on fishing (Nile perch, catfish, soft-shell turtles) and hunting
        (hippos, bovids, small carnivores and crocodiles). Microlithis, bone harpoon
        points and hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag impressed
        motif were found in burials, refuse areas and around the lake. A hiatus in
        the occupation of the area (6,200–5,200 years ago) occurred during a harsh
        arid interval, forcing the occupants to relocate. The Gobero population may
        not be the artists responsible for Dabous, but archaeological evidence can

        at the time of the engravings.

        result of human intervention such as trampling, graffiti and fragments being
        stolen. As a result, the decision was made to preserve them by making a mould
        of the carvings in order to make a cast in a resistant material. Permission
        was granted by both the government of Niger and UNESCO and in 1999 the moulding
        process took place. The first cast of the mould, made in aluminium, stands
        at the airport of Agadez in the small desert town near the site of Dabous
        – an enduring symbol of the rich rock art heritage of the country.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
      body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and
        the Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
        of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the
        Aïr Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years
        old. The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes
        both paintings and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock engraving
        is at a place called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here, two life-size
        giraffe were carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up to 6,000 years
        old. Other notable areas for engravings are Iwellene in the northern Aïr Mountains,
        where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years old, as well
        the sites of Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern Aïr Mountains, where
        engravings are located on the sides of two wadis (dry riverbeds).

      body: Links have been made between the rock art of Niger and that of several
        other countries – in particular, between the so-called Libyan Warrior art
        found in the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas
        in Mali. Stylistic similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart
        (Acacus) and in south-east Algeria. Further associations have been made between
        the Early Hunter art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west Libya and
        south-east Algeria. Equally, similarities have been observed with the Tazina-style
        engravings in south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 4'
      body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in
        this region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of art,
        dating from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing figures
        with metal weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors
        have been recorded from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des
        Iforas in bordering Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn,
        accessories, headdresses and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition
        of images, it has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan
        Warrior rock art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing,
        when metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took
        over from the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals
        such as Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.

      body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
        attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in
        Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between
        these rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe
        people of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising
        loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical
        and symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also
        physically dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting
        to note the close relationship between the rock art of regions that today
        are politically discrete.

      title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
      body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
        In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer,
        made two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make
        a serious study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr
        Mountains. Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around
        1960. However, it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major
        recording programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and
        publish several thousand engravings. Very little information is known relating
        the rock art to known cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the
        sites were not habitation sites, and were probably only occasionally visited
        by nomadic societies in the past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence
        remains. Most of the art predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit
        this area and who appear to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg
        recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles
        their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible to them if
        it is more than 100 years old.

      body: Early Hunter or Bubalus Period rock engravings are executed with deeply
        incised and smoothened lines, mainly depicting big game such as elephants,
        rhinoceros, giraffe and other game (with rhinoceros occurring most often),
        and are found on the Djado Plateau, as well as the Mangueni and Tchigai plateaux
        in north-east Niger. In the eastern Aïr Mountains, archaeological traces of
        human occupation during this early wet phase are evident, dating back 9,500
        years.

      body: Although the Bovidian Period is sparsely represented in comparison to
        other rock art regions, both on the Djado Plateau and the Aïr Mountains, this
        period can probably be dated to between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago. A few cattle
        are depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early Hunter Period,
        which raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding culture emerged
        from a hunting lifestyle, or at least rapidly succeeded it.

      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 12'
      body: Consisting predominantly of rock engravings and found in the Aïr Mountains,
        the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
        ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
        or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
        were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
        bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as
        Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the
        Horse Period is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that
        Berber groups did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been
        proposed that certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from
        Aïr.

      body: A small number of engravings from the Camel Period occur on the Djado
        Plateau, but as camels were introduced to the Sahara up to 2,000 years ago,
        the relative lack of depictions suggests that the plateau was scarcely frequented
        during this hyper-arid period.
