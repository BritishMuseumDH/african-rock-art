        These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

        These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

      body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
        accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver but
        who we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood
        both materials and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process
        of carving. But even more than this, the artist understood the environmental
        conditions in which he was working. It has been observed that the depth and
        thickness of the engraved lines has been carefully calculated to ensure that
        as the sun travels across them during the day, they appear to move. This sense
        of movement is made most acute as the evening shadows, falling into each groove,
        give the cattle a sense of mass and movement. Other artistic devices, such
        as double lines with recessed areas and internal polishing, evoke a perception
        of depth and density. The interplay of light and shade is consummately adept
        and dynamic, and the sculptural quality of the image sensorially evocative.
        This is the work of a practised craftsman, who demonstrates a deep of understanding
        of materials, techniques and the natural environment.

      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 1'
      body: Algeria is Africa’s largest country geographically and has long been noted
        for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
        inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
        and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique
        insights into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in
        the country across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly
        famous for its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the
        1930s by French archaeologist Henry Lhote.

      title: Geography
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
      body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on
        the west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
        coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along
        the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of
        mountains, valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within
        the Sahara Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar
        Mountains but the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range
        of Tassili n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water
        and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches,
        and high-pillared rocks, described by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

        The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

      title: Early rock art
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
      body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past
        vibrant fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros,
        hippopotamus and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals
        such as antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period
        they are very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than
        simply hunting scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own place within
        their environment and their relationship with it.

      title: Round Head Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
      body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to
        be up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on
        the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period
        comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless
        bodies, often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics
        of Round Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area,
        and the depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally,
        making particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial
        activity. The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep)
        and antelope, but they are represented only in static positions and not as
        part of a hunting scene.

      title: Pastoral Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 6'
      body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
        a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
        with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images
        are stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural
        groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep,
        goats and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations
        of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more
        settled communities.

      title: Horse Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

        Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.

        to include domestic animals and armed figures.
