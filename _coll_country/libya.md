      body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the
        world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
        sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always
        so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone
        major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During
        this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert
        were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal
        patterns led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse.
        The analysis of archaeological sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains
        tell us of a greener world, where some of the earliest attempts at domestication
        of animals and rudimentary farming took place.

        Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

        The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

        It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

        and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads to depict
        eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting. The
        specific type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars. Some
        have described them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and men.
        Their pointed ears could also identify them as cat-like figures, although
        most probably they were the representation of mythical beings, considering
        their prominence above all other figures in this area. A polished line comes
        out from the waist of both figures to join four small ostriches, depicted
        between them, which often accompany rock art in this region.

        fertility-related meaning. The difference in style and technique may point
        to the woman as a later addition to the panel, taking advantage of the polished
        surface, but respecting the main scene.

        Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

        As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 1'
      body: 'Rock art occurs in two main areas in Libya: the Tadrart Acacus and the
        Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains, are
        engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and
        could be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to
        8,000-9,000 years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting,
        pastoralism, daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals.
        The Messak Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a
        few paintings have been located in this region to date. The area is best known
        for larger-than-life-size engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and
        bubalus (a now extinct buffalo), and some of the most iconic depictions in
        Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting Cats’ scene.'

      title: Geography
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 2'
      body: The fourth largest country in Africa, Libya is located in the Maghreb
        region of North Africa, bordered on the west by Tunisia and Algeria, Egypt
        to the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Except for the narrow
        strip along the coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely
        within the Sahara Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western
        corner of the country, with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern
        Algeria, where they are simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya and
        the Tadrart in Algeria are now listed and combined as a trans-frontier World
        Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking these two geographically divided sites into
        a cultural whole.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 3'
      body: The Messak rock art has been known to Europeans since Heinrich Barth’s
        expedition in 1850, although it was not until 1932 that the engravings were
        methodically studied by Leo Frobenius. Some initial interpretative hypotheses
        about the rock art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian
        archaeologist Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject
        of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist,
        who also published the first scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s.
        Since then, consistent surveying has continued in this region and stratigraphic
        excavations of archaeological deposits have established a cultural sequence
        dating back to the Holocene Period.

      title: Chronology and early rock art
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

        The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

      title: Round Head Period
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
      body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
        sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
        equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
        remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
        sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
        of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400
        BC, may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been
        connected chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of
        paintings in this period portray very large figures with round, featureless
        heads and can often be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have
        their hands raised, interpreted as postures of supplication.

      title: Pastoral Period
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 6'
      body: The introduction of domesticates into the region has been identified archaeologically
        at around 8,000 years ago, although full exploitation of cattle for dairying
        is much later at around 6,000 years ago. The development to full pastoral
        systems in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is challenging to track
        any changes from the rock art itself, but the painting of large herds must
        be connected to a full pastoral society.

      title: Horse and Camel Periods
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

        The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.
