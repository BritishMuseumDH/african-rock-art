  title: Other aquatic species
  title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 8'
  body: Other aquatic species are more difficult to identify and are much rarer. For
    example, Fig 12a has been interpreted as a jelly-fish like creature. The photograph
    here has been digitally manipulated to enhance the image and on closer inspection
    However, by manipulating the colour and lighting as in Fig. 12b, the image is
    a little clearer and appears to share morphological characteristics with a turtle
    rather than a jellyfish – such as the rounded carapace and small flippers – with
    a turtle rather than a jellyfish. Furthermore, we know that softshell turtles
    (*Trionyx triunguis*) have been found in archaeological deposits in the Sahara
    dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands hanging down underneath
    could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles when walking rather than
    being the tendrils of a jellyfish. Moreover, Fig 13 appears to resemble a snail
    and would be consistent with what we know about the Capsian culture who inhabited
    modern Tunisia and Algeria and parts of Libya during the early Holocene (10,000–6,000
    BC). Their distinguishing culinary feature was a fondness for escargots – edible
    land snails.
