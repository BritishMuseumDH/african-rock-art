  title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
  body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
    by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
    ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain ‘geometric’
    or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of San|Bushman people
    and their ancestors.  Although San|Bushman communities now live mainly in Namibia,
    Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically San|Bushman cultural groups
    lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer people are thought
    to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South Africa until the arrival
    of herding and farming people from the north from around 2,000 years ago.
