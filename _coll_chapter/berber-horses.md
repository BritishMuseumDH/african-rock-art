  title: Berber Horses
  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
  body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot as a
    weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo tell us of
    the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians, a Berber
    group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century BC. Berber
    peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and riding, and the
    later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber horsemen, or the sight
    of them. Although horses may already have reached the areas of modern Mauritania
    and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence does not confirm their presence
    in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara until much later, in the mid-1st
    millennium AD, and it has been suggested that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania
    may be as recent as 16th century.
