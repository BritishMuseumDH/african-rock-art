  title: Introduction - Geography and rock art distribution
  title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 1'
  body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
    and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between the Zambezi
    and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude. The
    highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain range
    reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas, the northern
    region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland. These areas
    are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent shelters for the
    paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one of the most outstanding
    examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total number of Zimbabwean rock art
    sites is unknown, but estimations made point to thousands of sites throughout
    the country, with more being discovered annually. '
