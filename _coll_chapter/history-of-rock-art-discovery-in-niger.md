  title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
  title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
  body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger. In
    the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer, made two
    great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make a serious study
    of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the AÃ¯r Mountains. Subsequently,
    French colonial officers noted some sites around 1960. However, it was French
    archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major recording programmes throughout
    the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and publish several thousand engravings.
    Very little information is known relating the rock art to known cultural groups,
    either past or present. Most of the sites were not habitation sites, and were
    probably only occasionally visited by nomadic societies in the past, so very little
    (if any) archaeological evidence remains. Most of the art predates the residence
    of the Tuareg, who now inhabit this area and who appear to have no direct connections
    with the art. The Tuareg recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images
    as it closely resembles their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible
    to them if it is more than 100 years old.
