  title: Early rock art
  title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
  body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past vibrant
    fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus
    and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals such as antelope
    and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period they are very small
    in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than simply hunting scenes,
    they are likely to reflect peopleâ€™s own place within their environment and their
    relationship with it.
