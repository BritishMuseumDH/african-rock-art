  title: Introduction
  title_internal: 'Contact Art: thematic, chapter 1'
  body: "The impact of colonisation in South Africa as a result of Dutch and English
    settlement from 1652 onwards has been well-documented - with devastating consequences
    socially, economically and culturally for many indigenous populations. \nOne of
    those impacts was the demise of rock art as a cultural practice by many San|Bushmen,
    with the last rock art being made around 100 years ago. Nevertheless, rock art
    has provided some interesting glimpses into Colonial events, experiences and encounters
    from an indigenous perspective. Depictions of ships, horse-drawn wagons, guns
    and people wearing European clothing are not simply observational records in stone,
    but tell of history and heritage, memory and identity. This type of rock art,
    one that depicts European objects and people, is termed '*contact art*'.\n"
