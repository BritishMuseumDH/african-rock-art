  title: Themes
  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 8'
  body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the wider
    hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar in theme
    and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition, which
    is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.  Imagery includes
    scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements, wild animals and unidentified
    shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human figures dominate in the paintings
    of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the painted figures, and where the gender
    can be recognised, they are more commonly male than female.  Prominent painting
    subjects and styles in the rock art of Namibia (particularly the best-studied
    west-central region) include, at some sites, clearly delineated dots and patterns
    on human figures, a particular tradition of showing human figures with voluminous
    decorated hairstyles, and more images of giraffe and kudu, gemsbok and springbok
    antelope than in other southern African regions.  Other images of animals include
    those of zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and ostriches.  More occasional motifs
    found include plants, cattle, sheep and handprints. \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective
    term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living
    in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San'
    and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups,
    although others have positively adopted them."
