  title: Dating engravings
  title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 5'
  body: 'The study of engravings is even more difficult, as it is based on the changes
    that affect their surface after they were made. The most obvious is a progressive
    change in colour, making the older engravings seems “darker” than the newer. When
    the changes in colour are due to chemical, internal processes, the term used is
    *patina*, while when they are caused by the accumulation of particles the process
    is known as *varnishing*. Finally, the progressive weathering of the engraving’s
    traces can also be measured. By studying the pace of these natural processes,
    scientists can propose dates for the engravings. However, as with carbon-14, these
    methods have several problems that affect their suitability: the study of these
    natural processes is slow and costly, and the results can only be applied to small,
    concrete areas. There are also problems with the accuracy of the measurements,
    and risks of contamination of samples are high. Therefore, although they are promising,
    the absolute dating methods are still far from providing generalized and relatively
    easy ways to reliably date rock art.'
