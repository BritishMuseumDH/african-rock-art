  body: 'The investigations of these researchers and those who have followed them
    have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of success.
    Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels with
    the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian rock
    art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed at through
    corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their chariot use, and
    the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central Sahara, it has been
    suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time as – the height of the
    Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed a local power around
    what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However, opportunities to anchor
    rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures are few and far between,
    and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers, nomadic peoples,
    or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons made with contemporary
    groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'
