  title: Late White Paintings
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 7'
  body: White finger-painted images appear more crudely executed and are made from
    a powdery or greasy white pigment. More than 200 paintings at 20 different sites
    show paintings in this style, half of these depictions occur in White Paintings
    Shelter alone. Subject matter includes people facing forwards with their hands
    on hips, figures riding horses, a possible wagon wheel and a figure standing on
    a wagon, as well as an elephant, rhino, giraffe, eland, cows, antelope, snakes,
    unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly “m” shapes. White paintings
    occur at sites with red paintings and often superimpose them.
