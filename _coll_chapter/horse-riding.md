  title: Horse Riding
  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 4'
  body: As well as the unique iconography of rock art chariot depictions, there are
    also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people riding
    horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of horse domestication,
    though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being ridden come from the
    Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC. Images of horses and riders
    in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco, Egypt and Sudan and are particularly
    notable in the Ennedi region of Chad and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania
    (interestingly, however, no definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel
    Uweinat area at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).
