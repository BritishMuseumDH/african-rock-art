    __Absolute/Relative dating__

    Little research has been conducted, either on absolute or relative rock art chronologies in central Africa, and is therefore still poorly understood by comparison with northern and southern Africa. Promising recent radiocarbon dates have been reported from paintings in Angola, but the absence of contextual information with these dates renders them unproductive. Dating rock art by association with archaeological deposits has not proved entirely successful either. Relative chronologies have been suggested, and while there are regional variations, in general two styles of rock art have been identified and associated with a relative chronology: Twa and Sandawe.

    __Stylistic dating__

    Twa-style art dates to around 3,000 to 1,000 years ago and was made by hunter-gatherer groups in eastern and central Africa. Depictions of animals are rare in Twa art and usually consist of geometric designs, often concentric circles. Ancestral Sandawe art, found mainly in central Tanzania, is thought to date from around 9,000 years ago to the recent past, and includes fairly large naturalistic images of animals in both hunting and domestic scenes. Figures are frequently holding bows and arrows, and are often depicted with elaborate hairstyles and/or headdresses.
