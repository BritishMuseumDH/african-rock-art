  title: Horses and chariots
  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
  body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
    to Africa- is usually cited at around 1,600 BC, linked with the arrival in Egypt
    of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt during
    the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably only been domesticated
    for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot after the 3rd millennium
    BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable martial asset in the ancient
    world. One of the first clear records of the use of horses and chariots in battle
    in Africa is found in depictions from the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose
    at Abydos from around 1,525 BC, showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the
    Hyksos, and horses feature prominently in later Egyptian art.
