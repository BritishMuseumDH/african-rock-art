  title: Types of rock art
  title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
  body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the most
    widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous known
    examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples found in
    Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings, with
    both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and composition
    varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of the southern Drakensberg
    and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho contain a higher proportion of
    images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia in turn feature more giraffes.
    \ There are also regional variations in style and colour: in some sites and areas
    paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured) while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences
    also occur in composition between painting and engraving sites, with paintings
    more likely to feature multiple images on a single surface, often interacting
    with one another, while engraving sites more often include isolated images on
    individual rocks and boulders.  However, there are commonalities in both imagery
    and style, with paintings throughout southern Africa often including depictions
    of people, particularly in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.
    \ Also heavily featured in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular
    large ungulates which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great
    detail.  Additionally, images may include people and animals which appear to have
    the features of several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer
    type paintings are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy
    of their rendering with a thin brush.  \n"
