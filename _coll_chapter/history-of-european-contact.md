  body: Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese mariners navigated the western coast
    of Africa exploiting the lucrative trade possibilities on the continent. In 1487,
    Bartholomeu Dias’s expedition of two 50-ton caravels (small, fast Portuguese sailing
    ships of the 15th–17th centuries) anchored in Mossel Bay on the Southern Cape
    coast because of a storm, later sailing along the coast to Algoa Bay (east of
    the Cape of Good Hope) before returning to Lisbon. Ten years later, in 1497 another
    Portuguese expedition led by Vasco de Gama sailed along the eastern coastline
    to modern day Mombasa before crossing the Indian Ocean to India (Thompson, 2014:31)
