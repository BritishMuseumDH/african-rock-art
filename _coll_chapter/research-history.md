  body: 'Rock art sites throughout what is now South Africa have likely always been
    known to local communities, even where the art''s creators were not from within
    them. The presence of rock art in the Cape region has been known to Europeans
    since at least the mid- 18th century AD, with one of the first known reports from
    the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings near the
    Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references to rock art
    from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with some of the
    earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art made in the 1770s. During
    the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies were made of San|Bushman rock
    art by amateur artists such as George Stow, Mark and Graham Hutchinson and Helen
    Tongue. '
