  title: Case study – Gobero
  title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 9'
  body: A recently excavated cemetery site called Gobero (Fig. 14) (see citation),
    situated on the western edge of the Ténéré desert in Niger, provides a uniquely
    preserved record of human occupation in the Sahara during the Holocene and puts
    into context some of the examples of rock art we have looked at here. Pollen analysis
    has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated in an open savannah
    landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk, where permanent
    water and marshy habitats were present.
