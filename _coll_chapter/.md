  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 7'
  body: "Scholarly interest in Southern African rock art increased in the early 20th
    century and pioneering efforts were made to record both painting and engraving
    assemblages. In 1928 renowned archaeologist and ethnologist Leo Frobenius mounted
    an expedition to record sites in South Africa as well as Zimbabwe and Namibia,
    while in the interior regions over the previous twenty years, Maria Wilman had
    instigated the first systematic rock engraving recording work. This endeavor was
    built upon from the late 1950s onwards with the extensive work of Gerhard and
    Dora Fock.  In the same decade Alex Willcox pioneered the practice of recording
    rock art through colour photography, and over the next twenty years, further recording
    and analysis projects were undertaken by researchers such as Tim Maggs in the
    Western Cape region and Harald Pager and Patricia Vinnicombe in the Drakensberg
    mountain area. \n"
