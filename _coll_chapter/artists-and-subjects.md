  title: Artists and Subjects
  title_internal: 'Contact Art: thematic, chapter 11'
  body: "The identity of the artists and their relationships with the figures depicted
    is an interesting yet complex one. Do the images simply portray experiences of
    contact with Europeans or were the artists framing themselves within these tableaux?
    It is likely that wagons are the property of the Europeans and that the majority,
    if not all, of the passengers depicted are European. \n\nA common posture for
    figures painted outside of the context of wagons is a characteristic hands-on-hips
    posture, which has been identified as an European stance. Interestingly, this
    is a universal convention employed by contact period artists around the world
    in their depiction of both male and female European colonists (Hall and Mazel,
    2005:142). This convention may possibly just be an observation of cultural differences,
    but as Hall and Mazel have suggested, “it potentially makes a wry comment about
    a posture of arrogance and people in the possession of idle hands“ (Hall and Mazel,
    12005:142). In the rock art of the Swartruggens there does not appear to be any
    intentionality on the part of the artists to insert themselves into the scenes,
    “the people, events and episodes depicted are of the Europeans’ world and the
    art seems to be all about ‘outsiders’” (Hall and Mazel, 2005:143).\n"
