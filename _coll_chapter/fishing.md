  title: Fishing
  title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 6'
  body: Fish are likely to have been caught in a variety of ways, but in the Sahara
    the most common technique was to use barbed bone point and/or fish hook technology,
    with the former being the most archaeologically visible. Barbed points may either
    be fixed – that is permanently attached to a spear or arrow shaft – or used as
    ‘harpoons’, when they separate from a shaft on impact and remain attached by a
    line. Barbed points can actually be used to catch multiple types of prey, but
    the primary use across Africa was for fish.
