  title: History of the research
  title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
  body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles Burkitt
    visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius, one of the
    most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century. Leo Frobenius
    travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly documented numerous
    paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic features of Zimbabwean
    rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors of the paintings, ascribing
    them to external influences of “high civilizations” instead to the local communities
    who made them. Subsequently, work was continued by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall,
    who for forty years documented rock art paintings constituting a huge corpus of
    tracings, but without developing an interpretative framework for them. In the
    1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and
    studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian or Minoan origin. It wasn’t
    until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective approach to the study of rock
    art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent figure in research from the
    1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive books on Zimbabwean rock
    art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general framework of southern Africa
    and raising awareness about the importance of these archaeological expressions.
    In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in the World Heritage List acknowledging
    the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art for African heritage. '
