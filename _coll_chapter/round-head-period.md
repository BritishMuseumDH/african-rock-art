  title: Round Head Period
  title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
  body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
    sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
    equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
    remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
    sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
    of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400 BC,
    may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been connected
    chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of paintings in this
    period portray very large figures with round, featureless heads and can often
    be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have their hands raised, interpreted
    as postures of supplication.
