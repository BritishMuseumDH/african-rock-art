  title: Pastoral Period
  title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 6'
  body: The introduction of domesticates into the region has been identified archaeologically
    at around 8,000 years ago, although full exploitation of cattle for dairying is
    much later at around 6,000 years ago. The development to full pastoral systems
    in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is challenging to track any changes
    from the rock art itself, but the painting of large herds must be connected to
    a full pastoral society.
