  title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
  body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the Eastern
    Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula. These mixed
    influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features throughout
    the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages of research
    in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia and the Arabian
    Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the term *Ethiopian-Arabian*
    rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research thread proposes a progressive
    evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging from the 4th-3rd millennium BC
    to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian* proposal is still widely accepted
    and stylistic similarities between the rock art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or
    Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices have been raised against the term because
    of its excessive generalisation and lack of operability. In addition, recent research
    to the south of Ethiopia have started to discover new rock art sites related to
    those found in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa
    rock art, cattle depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted
    either isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
    their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
    dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and fighting
    scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also common, usually
    associated with other depictions; and in some places they have been interpreted
    as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting is common in most regions,
    with many regional variations. \n"
