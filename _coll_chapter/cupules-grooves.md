  title: Cupules/Grooves
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
  body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
    but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into the
    rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been chipped
    and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female Hill, with
    four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure about 5cm
    or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although larger examples occur. They can
    occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For the most part they
    are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three cases, considerably more.
    For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved into a vertical wall and nearly
    1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or meaning of cupules is unknown; they
    may have denoted a special place or the number of times a site had been visited.
    However, we have no dates for any of the cupules and even if they are adjacent
    to a rock art site, they are not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina
    and general wear it has been proposed that some cupules may date back tens of
    thousands of years to the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed at this
    time they have long since disappeared.
