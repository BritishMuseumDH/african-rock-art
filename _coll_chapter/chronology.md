  body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after the
    moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work) are not
    thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock pieces.  The
    only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated deposits in Namiba
    so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest painted shelter
    in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer radiocarbon dated
    to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed rock surface into
    which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this, estimates at the age
    of rock art are based on superimposition, patination and associated archaeological
    finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence, it is thought that the majority of
    the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art in the Brandberg area was produced between
    around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, with the painting tradition in the wider region
    starting as much as 6,000 years ago. This ceased sometime after the introduction
    of small domestic stock to the area, although not immediately, as fine-line paintings
    of sheep and paintings and engravings of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia,
    there appears to be a particularly strong correspondence of finds relating to
    paintings—such as grinding equipment and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st
    millennium BC.\n"
