  body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
    from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
    at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing dates.
    \ Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world have been
    found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably being the painted
    plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around 30,000 years ago.  A portion
    of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s Northern Cape is estimated to be
    10,200 years old and painted spalls from shelter walls in Zimbabwe have been dated
    to 12,000 years ago or older.  However, it is thought that the majority of existing
    rock art was made more recently.  As ever, subject matter is also helpful in ascribing
    maximum date ranges.  We know, for example,that images of domestic animals are
    probably less than 2,000 years old.  The condition of the art may also help to
    establish relative ages, particularly with regards to engravings, which may be
    in some cases be categorised by the discolouration of the patina that darkens
    them over time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art sites throughout southern Africa
    form a major component of southern Africa’s archaeological record, with many interesting
    clues about the lives of past inhabitants and, in some cases, continuing religious
    and cultural importance for contemporary communities.  Many sites are open to
    the public, affording visitors the unique experience of viewing rock art in situ.
    \ Unfortunately, the exposed nature of rock art in the field leaves it open to
    potential damage from the environment and vandalism.  Many  major rock art sites
    in southern Africa are protected by law in their respective countries and the
    Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South Africa and Lesotho, Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in
    Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe are all inscribed
    on the UNESCO World Heritage list. \n"
