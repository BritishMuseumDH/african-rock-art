    Relative chronologies aim to organise the images from the oldest to the more recent, even if their exact dates are not known, providing the relative position of groups of depictions over time. It uses methods such as the analysis of superimpositions (the figures on the top have to be younger than those underneath), the study of depictions of animals already extinct or newly introduced in areas (for example, camels in the Sahara) or objects that have a known timeframe of usage, such as ships, firearms, chariots, etc.

    In some cases, graffiti can be found alongside figures, and linguistic studies can help to determine the age of both texts and depictions. Of course, one of the best ways to establish a relative date for rock art is when it is covered by archaeological deposits that can be dated through radiocarbon methods or archaeological materials. However, that date only states the minimum age of the rock art depictions, as they could have been covered hundreds or thousands of years after the images were painted or engraved. Moreover, these situations are very rare, as most of the time rock art is situated in the open air, without associated archaeological sites.
