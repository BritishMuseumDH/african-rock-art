  title: Petroglyphs – Engraving
  title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 4'
  body: Three techniques were generally used to remove the rock surface; incising/engraving
    (lines are cut into the rock with a sharp tool); pecking (hammering and chipping
    away at the rock surface) and scraping. Rock faces were sometimes ‘prepared’ by
    scraping, allowing for an improved surface on which to inscribe the image. Incising
    or engraving involves scratching into the stone surface using a sharp lithic flake
    or metal blade. Pecking is a form of indirect percussion whereby a second rock
    is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the rock face, while scraping
    is created using a hard hammerstone, which is battered against the rock surface.
    A last, much rarer method of engraving is the bas-relief technique, where the
    area around the image is lowered (usually by polishing) thus making the figure
    raise over the surface.
