  title: Farmer rock art
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 4'
  body: "Some paintings and engravings in South Africa were made by Bantu language-speaking
    farming people.  These include a distinct tradition of rock shelter paintings
    found in the north-west of the country, featuring mostly white finger-painted
    images of animals such as crocodiles and giraffes and other motifs.  These paintings,
    located in remote areas, are known to have been created by Northern Sotho people.
    Further to the south and west, engraved designs showing conjoined circle motifs
    are found throughout KwaZulu Natal and some areas of Mpumalanga and Gauteng Provinces,
    and appear to have been made by the ancestors of Sotho-Tswana and Nguni language
    speakers, perhaps ancestors of modern Zulu people.\n\n"
