  title: Game Pass Shelter, South Africa
  title_internal: 'South Africa: featured site, chapter 1'
  body: "Game Pass shelter is one of the most well-known rock art sites in South Africa.
    Situated in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, a sandstone recess atop
    a steep slope contains rock paintings made by people from the San|Bushman¹ communities
    who historically lived as hunter-gatherers throughout southern Africa. The Drakensberg
    mountains in particular are known for their wealth of rock paintings, often showing
    detailed and brightly coloured images of people, animals and part-human, part-animal
    figures known as ‘therianthropes’, with this site a prime example. One of the
    panels of paintings here is particularly important in the history of rock art
    research, as in the 1970s it helped to inspire a new kind of approach to the understanding
    of the meanings and symbolism of San|Bushman paintings and engravings.\n\n"
