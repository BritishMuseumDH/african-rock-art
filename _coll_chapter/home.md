  body: Moreover, as well as the adjacencies of European and local material culture,
    rock art depictions show that traditional belief systems were incorporated into
    these tableaux. Some images depict figures engaged in dancing a variation of the
    Trance Dance, a traditional San medicine dance whereby shamans would enter altered
    states of consciousness and are represented transforming into symbolic animals
    such as the eland. Contact rock art amalgamates this with elements of Nguni (a
    local and indigenous cultural group of South Africa) culture and shamans transform
    instead into baboons, a symbolic animal for the Nguni that is associated with
    ideas of protection (Challis, 2014:249).
