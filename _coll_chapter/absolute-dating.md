  title: Absolute Dating
  title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 4'
  body: The second type of dating is called absolute dating and provides concrete
    dates (or more often, intervals of age) in which the images were made. Although
    this could seem the perfect solution for the dating of paintings, the methods
    of absolute dating can only be used in very specific contexts, and often have
    serious problems of accuracy and reliability. The most efficient is based on the
    radiocarbon (carbon-14) method, measuring the amount of carbon remaining in pigments,
    although in many depictions the remnants of paint are so sparse that the size
    of the samples is too low to be measured. Besides, this method is destructive,
    as part of the painting has to be removed from the original site to collect the
    sample.
