  title: 'Categories: CENTRAL AFRICA'
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
  body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known as
    Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa to denote
    any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa can be divided
    into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically from the Tanzanian
    depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites are currently known from
    within this area. The vast majority, around 90%, consist of finger-painted geometric
    designs; the remaining 10% include highly stylised animal forms (with a few human
    figures) and rows of finger dots. Both types are thought to date back many thousands
    of years. The two traditions co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central
    Africa and while often found in close proximity to each other are only found together
    at a few sites. However, it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this
    rock art tradition very distinctive from other regions in Africa.
