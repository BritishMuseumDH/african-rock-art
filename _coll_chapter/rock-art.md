  title: Rock Art
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 2'
  body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San|Bushmen rock
    art in both techniques and subject matter. San|Bushmen paintings are well-known
    throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because they were brush
    painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition, 160 depictions
    of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals, and more geometric
    designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal drawings are larger and
    the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In comparison to human
    figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo appear without bows and
    arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In addition, numerous
    cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces, sometimes close
    to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents of Tsodilo,
    the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.
