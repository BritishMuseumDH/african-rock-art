  title: Interpretation
  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
  body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
    in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This postulates
    that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman shamans entering
    trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily life, the depictions
    of animals and activities are highly symbolic within San|Bushman cosmology, with
    images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.  This avenue of interpretation
    originates largely from the study of rock art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While
    it appears broadly applicable here, the fact that direct attributions to known
    cultural groups in this area are difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons
    with Namibian rock art.  While hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South
    Africa was practiced until the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia
    around a thousand  years ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area
    have no tradition of rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles
    and different geographical environments separate the rock art centres of north-western
    Namibia from those in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent in
    the differences in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions
    of gemsbok and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert
    dwellers where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent from
    rock art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found. \n"
