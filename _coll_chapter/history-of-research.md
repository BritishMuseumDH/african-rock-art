  body: Although the existence of rock art throughout the Sahara was known to local
    communities, it was not until the nineteenth century that it became known to Europeans,
    thanks to explorers such as Heinrich Barth, who crossed the Messak Plateau in
    Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings. Further explorations
    in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers, ethnographers and archaeologists
    such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László Almásy, Henri Lhote and Leo Frobenius
    brought the rock art of Sahara, and northern Africa in general, to the awareness
    of a European public.
