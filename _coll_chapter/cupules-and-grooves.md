  title_internal: 'Botswana: country, chapter 8'
  body: Cupules and grooves engravings can be found in the Tsodilo Hills, and also
    in the eastern part of the country in Tuli Block and Gubatshaa Hills. Engravings
    include human footprints and animal tracks. Most sites with engravings and/or
    cupules occur near water; for example at the site of Riverslee in the Tuli Block
    they encircle a waterhole while at Basinghall the cupule site is near the Limpopo
    River.
