  body: Uganda is located in East Africa, comprises an area of 236,040 kmÂ² and shares
    borders with Kenya to the east, South Sudan in the north, Democratic Republic
    of Congo in the west, and Rwanda and Tanzania in the south. It sits in the heart
    of the Great Lakes region, flanked by Lake Edward, Lake Albert and Lake Victoria,
    the latter being the second largest inland freshwater lake in the world, containing
    numerous islands. While much of its border is lakeshore, the country is landlocked.  Predominantly
    plateau, Uganda is cradled by mountains with Margherita peak (5,199m) on Mount
    Stanley the third highest point in Africa.
