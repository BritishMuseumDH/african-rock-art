  body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
    groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites. Hunter-gatherer
    and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock shelters and in some
    instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo paintings have been
    scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed the earliest dates for
    the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa may be up to 40,000 years
    old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001) up to 10,000 years old. Masao
    (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps 3000 years old. These are estimates
    and not based on radiometric dating techniques, and as the paintings have been
    exposed to considerable weathering these very early dates currently cannot be
    substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer or Sandawe rock art is
    characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images of animals, human figures,
    handprints and circular designs. These are the earliest paintings, thought to
    date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe,
    a hunter-gatherer group indigenous to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition
    of rock art occurs in the Kondoa region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration
    of less than a 100km in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution
    of the Sandawe people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope,
    plus a few birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than half
    of the images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted: cloven
    hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"
