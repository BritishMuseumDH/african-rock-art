  title: The symbolism of the horse
  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 9'
  body: However, caution must be taken in drawing such comparisons based on morphology
    alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative paucity
    of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity of horse depictions
    throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic. This variation is
    not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period and geography – but
    also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot be divorced from the
    other images around them, on whichever surface has been chosen, and are integral
    to these surroundings.
