    __Stylistic dating__

    The importance of dating has been at the forefront of much research in North African rock art, yet there is no consensus of opinion about the precise dating of the phases of rock art in this region. The construction of rock art sequences has been predicated on stylistic analysis, on which most scholars agree in principle, and broadly conforms to the following:


    - *Early Hunter*, *Wild Fauna* Period or *Bubalus* Period: 12,000 – 8,000 years ago
    - *Round Head* Period: 10,000 – 8,000 years ago
    - *Pastoral* Period: 7,500 – 4,000 years ago
    - *Horse* Period: 3,000 – 2,000 years ago
    - *Camel* Period: 2,000 years ago – present

    For the most part, there is general agreement on the dating of the Horse and Camel period, but the earliest phases of rock art - the *Bubalus*/*Round Head*/*Pastoral* periods, are much more contentious. Researchers Henri Lhote and Alfredo Muzzolini have argued that the *Pastoral* period begins around 6,000 years ago, while others, such as Fabrizio Mori, propose an earlier date of 8,000 years ago. Domestic stock is thought to have existed in the Sahara from around 7,500 years ago, making a date of 8,000 years old for paintings of cattle (which may have been wild) feasible. Dating the end of this period is just as problematic, with Lhote and Mori placing it between 3,000-4,000 years ago and Muzzolini about 1,000 years later. However, the largest discrepancy relates to the *Bubalus* and *Round Head* periods, where significantly disparate chronologies have been proposed by Lhote, Mori and Muzzolini. The most extreme of these is the *Bubalus* period, where Mori advocates an Early/Long chronology proposing that the earliest images date back 12,000 years, while Muzzolini suggests a Recent/Short chronology proposing a much later emergence of art in the region at 6,000 years ago.

    The application of direct dating will be central in resolving these substantial differences and has yielded some fruitful results on archaeological sites in making meaningful correlations. However, for the time being, the chronologies of Saharan rock art remain ambiguous and contested.
