  title: Herder rock art and other traditions
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
  body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong to
    other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
    with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found at
    sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work of the
    Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to the San|Bushmen.
    Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition. Local rock art traditions
    specific to certain areas include, among others, conglomerations of handprints
    near the coast in the south-western part of the Western Cape and rows of engraved
    cupules in the north east of the country. There are also several examples from
    different rock art traditions across South Africa, of depictions of European people,
    items or events (such as horses and firearms) which clearly date from the 17th
    century or later.  In the Karoo region, rock gongs (natural rock formations with
    indentations indicating that they have been used as percussive instruments) are
    sometimes associated with engraving sites.
