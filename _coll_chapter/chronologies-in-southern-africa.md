  title: Chronologies in southern Africa
  title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 8'
  body: Although a vast amount of work has been undertaken in rock art research in
    southern Africa, the focus has been largely placed on the meaning of images and
    their place within a rich ethnographic record. Little attention has been given
    to investigating temporal and spatial relationships, and as such there is a conspicuous
    absence of secure regional chronologies for southern African rock art.
