  title: Who were the artists?
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
  body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at Tsodilo,
    as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles of rock
    art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San|BushmenÂ¹ in
    other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings attributed
    to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were painted by the
    Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers in the area who
    made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man (a Central San people)
    claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible that some or many of
    the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white
    paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship, although as they are comparable
    to the red paintings, comprising the same subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe
    and antelope as well as geometrics, they may reflect a later version of the red
    tradition.\n\n"
