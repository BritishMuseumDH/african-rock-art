  title: History of rock art research in Tanzania
  title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
  body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in 1908
    by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the 1930s.
    Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German physician,
    amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more than 70 rock shelters
    in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and Louis Leakey (1983) were the
    first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania during the 1930s and 1950s
    (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting over 1600 painted images at
    186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and during the 1980s Fidelis Masao
    (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and excavated four of them while Emmanuel
    Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa. Other researchers include Eric ten
    Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel
    Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom have recorded numerous sites, contributing to
    identifying chronologies, styles and possible interpretations. Conservation and
    preservation of the rock art has been of importance since the 1930s, and many
    of the paintings recorded by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are now severely deteriorated,
    or in some cases completely destroyed. '
