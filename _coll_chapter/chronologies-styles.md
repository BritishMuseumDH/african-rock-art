  body: "__Paintings__\n\nThe geometric rock art that predominates in Uganda is attributed
    to the Batwa cultural group. Modern Batwa are descendants of ancient aboriginal
    forest-dwelling hunter-gatherer groups based in the Great Lakes region of central
    Africa. Their rock art has been divided into two traditions: firstly, the red
    animal tradition that comprises finely painted representations of animals in red
    pigment painted in a figurative style. These are all in the far north-eastern
    corner of Uganda. Antelope are the most common animals depicted, but this imagery
    also includes elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, giraffe, hyena, warthog, wild pig,
    ostrich and buffalo. \n"
