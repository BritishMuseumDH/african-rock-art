  title: 'Categories: EAST AFRICA'
  title_internal: Intro to east africa, chapter 3.5
  body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are found
    in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi; scholars
    have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed paintings can
    be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those found stretching
    from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings include large, naturalistic
    animals with occasional geometric motifs. The giraffe is the most frequently painted
    animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant, rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted.
    Later images show figures with highly distinctive stylised human head forms or
    hairstyles and body decoration, sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes.
    The Sandawe and Hadza, hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and
    central Tanzania respectively, claim their ancestors were responsible for some
    of the later art.\n\nThe area in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than
    100km in diameter and occurs at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely
    to the known distribution of this group. There have been some suggestions that
    Sandawe were making rock art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular
    rituals, in particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate
    with the spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a
    range of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to
    simbo and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
    waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
    as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
    possessed in the dance."
