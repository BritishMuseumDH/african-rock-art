  title: Pictographs - Painting
  title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 2'
  body: The pigments used in paintings are dependent on local resources, but typically
    have been made of minerals such as ochre that comes in a variety of red, brown
    and yellow hues. White is derived from silica, china clay and gypsum and black
    is obtained from manganese minerals, charcoal or specularite. Once collected these
    minerals were ground to form a powder and mixed with liquids such as egg albumen,
    urine, blood, saliva or water to make the pigment easier to apply and to act as
    a binding agent. Current research is exploring new methods to be able to date
    these ingredients. A variety of tools have been used to apply the pigment onto
    rock surfaces including birdsâ€™ feathers, animal hair, grasses or reeds and fingers.
    This process is not simply a technological one, and for many cultural groups the
    pigment itself and the method of application are imbued with symbolic meaning.
