  title: Themes and interpretations
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
  body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San|Bushman paintings and engravings draw
    on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San|Bushman people living historically
    in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San|Bushman communities
    in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated and reinforced
    the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is proposed to reflect
    the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’, a tradition common
    to San|Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance state during which they visit
    a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual journeys or perform tasks on
    behalf of their communities. It is thought that the rock art panels may have acted
    as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans are considered to possess, with the
    rock face considered a veil between both worlds.  The images are thought to reflect
    trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’, images of figures with
    both human and animal features, explained as shamans who in a trance state feel
    themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other poses and features found in
    San|Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic' motifs—geometric shapes such
    as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted as reflecting visions that shamans
    experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion continues around the extent
    of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations for all aspects of San|Bushman
    art, with research ongoing and scholars also exploring the potential roles of
    other elements in rock art production, such as mythology or gender and initiation
    rites.  Other avenues of study include more regional foci, on specific cultural
    and temporal contexts and how the imagery may reflect local power dynamics through
    time.\n"
