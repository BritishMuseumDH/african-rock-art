  title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 5
  body: "Hunter-gatherer or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings
    and includes images of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs.
    These are the earliest paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years
    ago, and are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group indigenous
    to north-east Tanzania. \n\n"
