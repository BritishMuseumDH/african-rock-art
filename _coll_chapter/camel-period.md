  title: Camel Period
  title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 8'
  body: The last defined period stylistically is characterised by the depiction of
    camels, representing an alternative method of negotiating this arid and harsh
    landscape. Camels can travel for days without water and were used extensively
    in caravans transporting trade goods and salt. Depictions in this period continue
    to include domestic animals and armed figures.
